# Welcome to the Flask-Bootstrap sample application. This will give you a
# guided tour around creating an application using Flask-Bootstrap.
#
# To run this application yourself, please install its requirements first:
#
#   $ pip install -r sample_app/requirements.txt
#
# Then, you can actually run the application.
#
#   $ flask --app=sample_app dev
#
# Afterwards, point your browser to http://localhost:5000, then check out the
# source.

    # in detail inside the Flask docs:

    # We use Flask-Appconfig here, but this is not a requirement
    AppConfig(app)

    # Install our Bootstrap extension
    Bootstrap(app)

    # Our application uses blueprints as well; these go well with the
    # application factory. We already imported the blueprint, now we just need
    # to register it:
    app.register_blueprint(frontend)

    # Because we're security-conscious developers, we also hard-code disabling
    # the CDN support (this might become a default in later versions):
    app.config['BOOTSTRAP_SERVE_LOCAL'] = True

    # We initialize the navigation as well
    nav.init_app(app)
