    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall support\nprecise process accounting of CPU usage. This shall be accomplished by time\nstamping various kernel execution paths using the native platform high\nresolution counter. This accounting activity shall be run-time configurable,\nincluding partial or total disabling, via the proc file system. When totally\ndisabled no additional overhead will be measurable. Disabling or enabling\nprecise accounting shall not affect Linux native tick accounting. All data\nshall be accessible from the proc file system. For task perCPU metrics, a\nrange of 1 through N rows may be configured such that each row accrues metrics\nfor one CPU, a range in between 1 and N CPUs (all metrics summed together).\nWhere N is the number of logical CPUs. Additional Sub-requirements follow.",
