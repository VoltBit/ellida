    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide support for detecting a repeating reboot cycle due to recurring failures. This detection should happen in user space before system services are started. This type of failure requires a response due to the negative impact of repeatedly bringing up and taking down services. A configurable policy is needed to set thresholds of cycling and desired shutdown actions, such as exponential back off, shutdown, or notifying administrators.",
