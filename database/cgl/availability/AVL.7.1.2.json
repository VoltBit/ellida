    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a mechanism to enable multiple access paths from a node to storage devices. The software shall determine if multiple paths exist to the same port of the I/O device, and, with configurable controls, balance I/O requests across multiple host bus adapters. If multiple paths exist to the same device over two separate device ports on the same host bus adapter, those I/Os will not be balanced.",
