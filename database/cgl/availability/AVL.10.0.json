    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a mechanism and framework by which a custom application can be built so that it can be upgraded by replacing symbols in its live process. Dynamic replacement of symbols allows a process to access upgraded functions or values without requiring a process restart and in many circumstances can lead to improved process availability and uptime. The mechanism should be applied only to user applications. Patch to underlying distribution software component may lose distribution support.",
