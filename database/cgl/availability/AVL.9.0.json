    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a mechanism that enables a system to fallback to a previous \"known good\" boot image in the event of a catastrophic boot failure (i.e. failure to boot, panic on boot, failure to initialize HW/SW). System images are captured from the \"known good\" system and the system reboots to the latest good image. This mechanism would allow an automatic fallback mechanism to protect against problems resulting from system changes, such as program updates, installations, kernel changes, and configuration changes.\"",
