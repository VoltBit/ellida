    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a fast, communicationbased cluster node failure mechanism that is reflected in a cluster membership service. At a minimum, the cluster node failure mechanism maintains a list of the nodes that are currently active in the cluster. Changes in cluster membership must result in a membership event that can be monitored by cluster services, applications, and middleware that register to be notified of membership events. Fast node failure detection must not depend on a failing node reporting that the node is failing. However, self-diagnosis may be leveraged to speed up failure detection in the cluster. This requirement does not address the issue of how to prevent failing nodes from accessing shared resources (see CFH.3.0 Application Fail-Over Enabling).",
