    "description": "CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a way\nto fence a failed or errant node from shared resources, such as SAN storage,\nto prevent the failed node from causing damage to shared resources. Since the\nsurviving nodes in the cluster will want to failover resources, applications,\nand/or middleware to other surviving nodes in the cluster, the cluster must\nmake sure it is safe to do the failover. Killing the failed node is the\neasiest and safest way to protect shared resources from a failing node. If a\nfailing node can detect that it is failing, the failing node could kill itself\n(suicide) or disable its ability to access shared resources to augment the\nnode isolation process. However, the cluster cannot depend on the failing node\nto alter the cluster when it is failing, so the cluster must be proactive in\nprotecting shared resources.",
