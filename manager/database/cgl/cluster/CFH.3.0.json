Applications and nodes are monitored and a failover mechanism is\ninvoked when a failure is detected. Once a failure is detected, the\napplication failover mechanism must determine which policies apply to this\nfailover scenario and then begin the process to start a standby application or\ninitiate the re-spawn of an application within 1 second.",
